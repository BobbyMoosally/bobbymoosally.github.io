## Apple Pie
Using Swift, created a running game on iPad running iOS featuring a word guessing game complete with scoring, an updating image, buttons, and a progressively completing word on the bottom of the screen.

## Fundamentals of Engineering Honors (FEH) Robot Project
Over the course of SP20, myself and a team of 3 other first year honors engineering students designed, built, coded, and tested a robot from scratch to complete a predetermined course.

## FEH Software Design Project
Closing out AU19, two students worked together to build a complete piece of software on Ohio State's Proteus microcontroller. Equatable to a Rasberry Pi, the controller hosted a small screen and processor that could run g++ code. Our project consisted of a recreation of the famous chimpanzee experiment from The Primate Reasearch Instite of Kyoto University.
